# Fibonacci Functions and Merge Sort Implementation

This project includes implementations of both iterative and recursive Fibonacci sequence generators, as well as a recursive merge sort algorithm. The goal is to compare the performance of the iterative and recursive Fibonacci functions and provide a clear implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
